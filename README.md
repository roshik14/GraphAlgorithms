# GraphAlgorithms

## Intro
Implementation of several basic algorithms on graphs:
* Breadth first search
* Depth first search
* Dijkstra's algorithm
* Floydâ€“Warshall algorithm
* Prim's algorithm
* Ant colony optimization algorithm

## Note
**This project tested only for macOS/Linux systems. Requires gcc compilator.**
